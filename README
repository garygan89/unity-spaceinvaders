@description: Space Invaders game on Unity

- This project is compiled and built with Unity 2017.1.0f3 (64-bit) on Windows 10 x64.
- The executables files (Windows x64) is located inside the [Release] folder.

## External Asset Used
- Easy Weapons
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/easy-weapons-19365

## Game Features
- 3 Levels
-- Levels parameters can be added in LevelInfo.cs.
-- Available parameters are:
--- enemy number in x,y,z axes
--- enemy moving speed
--- enemy separation spacing
- Player scoring
- Multiple weapons selection
- Enemy killed effects
- Player lives (default is 3)
- FPS UI Overlay (current level, remaining enemies, total scores, player lives)

## Scoring method
- A player live is deducted when an alien hit the player body or ground.
- Current level is restarted when player lost a live. Total score is reset to 0.
- Game over when player lives is 0.

## Controls
```
Enter/Return: Start Game
F1: Show game control
F5: Reset game
WASD/Directional button: Player movement
Left mouse click: Fire weapon
R: Reload ammo
Spacebar: Jump
Num #1-9 / Scroll Wheels: Weapon selection
1: Pistol
2: M4
3: Shotgun
4: M79 Grenade Launcher (P)
5: Cluser Bomb Launcher
6: Beam Gun
7: Rail Gun (P)
8: Rocket Launcher (P)
```

*Currently only Raycast/Beam weapons will trigger the 'alien' collision effect.

## Future TODOS
- Leaderboard with Top 10 player scoring
- Persistent player data storing
- Randomize aliens spawning position and separation in further levels
- Variety of aliens moving behaviour instead of default linear speed movement in horizontal and vertical direction, e.g. zigzag, warp/teleport
- Per second update of movement instead of per frame movement update, i.e. similar to Space Invaders arcade 1s movement
- Scoring multiplier per level, e.g. 1x for Level1, 1.2x for Level2, etc..
- Space-like skybox and terrain (e.g. moon)
